# Bank-Simulation

You are going to implement a "bank simulation" in Java. The bank has customers and each
customer should have at least these properties:

- Customer ID : The unique number that separates one customer from the other.
(Beware that two customers with the same ID cannot be added)
- Name : Customer’s name
- Last name : Customer’s last name
- Sex(male/female) : Customer's gender
- Credit : The amount of money that customer has


Your simulation must supply at least these operations:
- Adding a new customer
- Deleting an existing customer (by customer ID)
- Listing all customers
- Listing customers by customer ID, name, last name or gender
- Updating a customers information (customer name, last name, gender)
- Adding money to bank, i.e raising credit
- Drawing money from the bank, i.e reducing credit (beware that credit cannot be
negative !)
